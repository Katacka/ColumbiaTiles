CSIMT.mp4 provides a summary as to the background behind this web app, what it is intended to do, and what I learned from creating it.

Additionally, please feel free to pull the codebase and check out the app via executing meteor run (please note, meteor must first be installed).
The website will then be visible at localhost:3000.
